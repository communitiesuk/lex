or \n\t\tii) such a park or garden, that the right cannot be purchased without seriously affecting the amenity or convenience of the house to which that land belongs, the Scarweather Sands Offshore Wind Farm Order 2004 (“the Order”) shall, in relation to that person, cease to authorise the purchase of the right and be deemed to authorise the purchase of that person’s interest in the whole of the relevant land including, where the land consists of such a park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the notice shall be deemed to have been served in respect of that interest on such date as the Tribunal directs. \n2) Any question as to the extent of the land in which the Order is deemed to authorise the purchase of an interest by virtue of subsection (1) of this section shall be determined by the tribunal. \n3) Where, in consequence of a determination of the Tribunal that it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section the Order is deemed by virtue of that subsection to authorise the purchase of an interest in land, the acquiring authority may, at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the date of the determination, withdraw the notice to treat in consequence of which the determination was made; but nothing in this subsection prejudices any other power of the authority to withdraw the notice. . \n6) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say— \n\ta) section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey); \n\tb) paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity); \n\tc) paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and \n\td) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority. \n7) Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified so as to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority have served notice to treat in respect of any right, they have power, exercisable in the like circumstances and subject to the like conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right (which will be deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act will be modified correspondingly. \n8) Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will etc.) applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question. \n9) Section 22 of the 1965 Act (interests omitted from purchase) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.

or \n\tb) any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person employed by it or of its contractors or agents whilst engaged upon the relevant works. \n2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under his supervision will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person employed by it or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this paragraph. *Compensation for train operators*\n\n16) \n1) The sums payable by the undertaker under paragraph 15 will include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs. \n2) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and the relevant train operators regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (1) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator. \n3) The obligation under sub-paragraph (1) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs is, in the event of default, enforceable directly by the train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (2). \n4) In this paragraph— \n\t- “relevant costs” (“costau perthnasol”) means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, or maintenance or failure of the relevant works or any such act or omission as mentioned in paragraph 15(1); and\n\t- “train operator” means any person who operates trains in accordance with a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993  or an exemption under section 7 of that Act.\n17) In the assessment of any sums payable under this Schedule, there is not to be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken, or any agreement entered into, by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably required and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable. *Saving for access agreements*\n\n18) \n1) Where, under this Schedule, Network Rail is required to give its consent or approval in respect of any matter, that consent or approval may be given subject to the condition that Network Rail complies with such of its obligations pursuant to any access agreement or any lease of a station or light maintenance depot as are relevant to that matter. \n2) In this paragraph, “access agreement” (“cytundeb mynediad”), “station” (“gorsaf”) and “light maintenance depot” (“gorsaf cynnal a chadw ysgafn”) have the meaning given by section 83 of the Railways Act 1993.

        "SCHEDULE 3 NEW PART 3A OF THE 2013 ACT (Introduced by section 18) \n\nSection 1) **Part 3A of the 2013 Act**\nIn the 2013 Act, after Part 3 insert— ## PART 3A\n## SENEDD CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARY REVIEWS\n\n\n\nSection 49A) **Senedd constituency boundary reviews**\n\n1) The Commission must conduct a Senedd constituency boundary review once in every review period. \n2) A Senedd constituency boundary review is a review of the Senedd constituencies for the purpose of determining whether those boundaries should change in order to give effect to the rules set out in section 49C. \n3) If in the course of a review the Commission determines that the boundaries of a Senedd constituency should change, the Commission must also determine— \n\ta) what the names of the affected constituencies should be; \n\tb) whether each affected constituency should be a county constituency or a borough constituency. \n4) But if in the course of a review the Commission determines that, while the boundaries of a Senedd constituency should not change, the name of the constituency or its designation as a county constituency or a borough constituency should change, it may determine— \n\ta) what the name of the constituency should be; \n\tb) whether it should be a county constituency or a borough constituency. \n5) For the purpose of subsection (1), “review period” means— \n\ta) the period beginning with 1 April 2025 and ending with 30 November 2028, \n\tb) the period of 8 years beginning with 1 December 2028, and \n\tc) each subsequent period of 8 years. \n\nSection 49B) **Notice of commencement of Senedd constituency boundary review**\n\n1) As soon as reasonably practicable after commencing a Senedd constituency boundary review, the Commission must publish a notice— \n\ta) stating that the Commission has commenced a review, and \n\tb) specifying the date on which the review commenced. \n2) In this Part, “review date” means the date specified in the notice under subsection (1)(b). \n\nSection 49C) **Constituency rules**\n\n1) The electorate for each Senedd constituency must be— \n\ta) no less than 90% of the electoral quota, and \n\tb) no more than 110% of the electoral quota. \n2) When considering during a Senedd constituency boundary review whether there should be changes to the Senedd constituencies, and what those changes should be— \n\ta) the Commission may have regard to— \n\t\ti) local government boundaries that exist or are prospective on the review date; \n\t\tii) special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a proposed or existing Senedd constituency; \n\t\tiii) any local ties (including local ties connected to the use of the Welsh language) that would be broken by such changes; but \n\tb) in any event the Commission must— \n\t\ti) seek to minimise the amount of change to the Senedd constituencies that exist on the review date, and \n\t\tii) have regard to the inconveniences caused by making changes to the Senedd constituencies. \n3) For the purposes of subsection (1)— \n\ta) the electorate is the total number of local government electors, and \n\tb) the electoral quota is the electorate of Wales divided by 16 (which is the number of Senedd constituencies), and for the purposes of paragraph (a), a local government elector is a person registered in the relevant version of the register of local government electors at an address within a Senedd constituency. \n4) The relevant version of the register of local government electors is the version that is, on the review date, the most recent version published under section 13(1)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. \u200d2) . \n5) In the case of a local government boundary that is prospective on the review date, it is that boundary (rather than any existing boundary that it replaces) that must be taken into account under subsection (2)(a)(i). \n6) A local government boundary is “prospective” on the review date if, on that date— \n\ta) it is specified in a provision of— \n\t\ti) primary legislation, or \n\t\tii) an instrument made under primary legislation, and \n\tb) the provision specifying the boundary is not yet in force for all purposes. \n7) In subsection (6), “primary legislation” means— \n\ta) an Act enacted under Part 4 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32) ; \n\tb) a Measure enacted under Part 3 of that Act; \n\tc) an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. \n\nSection 49D) **Determining the names of the Senedd constituencies**\n\n1) Each Senedd constituency must have\u200d\u200d a\u200d single name for the purposes of identifying the constituency in communication through Welsh and English, unless the Commission considers this would be unacceptable (in which case the constituency may have different names for the purposes of identifying it in communication through Welsh and English). \n2) Before making its initial report (see section 49E) the Commission must, if it intends to make a proposal relating to the name of a Senedd constituency— \n\ta) consult the Welsh Language Commissioner on the orthography of the proposed name, and \n\tb) consider its proposal having regard to any representations from the Commissioner on the orthography of the proposed name. \n3) A requirement under this Part to set out the name or proposed name of a Senedd constituency in a report is, where the Commission considers the constituency should have different names for the purposes of identifying it in communication through Welsh and English, a requirement to set out both names— \n\ta) in the Welsh language version of the report, and \n\tb) in the English language version of the report. \n\nSection 49E) **Initial report on boundary review and first period for representations**\n\n1) After taking the steps in sections 49B(1) and 49D(2), the Commission must make an initial report setting out— \n\ta) the Commission’s proposals for change to— \n\t\ti) the boundaries of the Senedd constituencies; \n\t\tii) the names of the Senedd constituencies, or \n\tb) if it does not consider any change appropriate, a statement to that effect. \n2) The Commission must— \n\ta) publish the initial report, \n\tb) inform any person it considers appropriate of how to access the report, \n\tc) invite representations on the report, and \n\td) notify any person it considers appropriate of the first period for representations. \n3) During the first period for representations the Commission must consult the Welsh Language Commissioner. \n4) The first period for representations is a period of eight weeks, beginning with the date on which the initial report is published. \n\nSection 49F) **Publication of, and consultation on, representations**\n\n1) At the end of the first period for representations the Commission must publish a document setting out any representations received during that period (including any representations on the initial report made by the Welsh Language Commissioner when consulted under section 49E(3)). \n2) The Commission must also— \n\ta) inform any person it considers appropriate of how to access the document published under subsection (1), \n\tb) invite representations in respect of the representations set out in the document published under subsection (1), \n\tc) notify any person it considers appropriate of the second period for representations, and \n\td) publish information about the times and places at which public hearings under section 49G will be held and, where hearings are to be held partly in person and partly through the use of remote facilities, specify instructions on how to make representations using remote facilities. \n3) The second period for representations is a period of six weeks, beginning with the date on which the document is published under subsection (1). \n4) In subsection (2)(d), “remote facilities” means any equipment or other facility that enables people who are not in the place where the hearing is being held to make representations at the hearing. \n\nSection 49G) **Public hearings**\n\n1) During the second period for representations, the Commission must hold at least two but no more than five public hearings to enable representations to be made about its proposals. \n2) The public hearings must between them cover the whole of Wales. \n3) A public hearing must be completed within two days. \n4) If a hearing is to be held partly through the use of remote facilities (within the meaning given in section 49F(4)), the remote facilities must enable the people making representations at the hearing but who are not in the place where the hearing is being held to speak to and be heard by (whether or not it enables those people to see and be seen by)— \n\ta) each other, and \n\tb) people at the place where the hearing is being held. \n5) The Commission must appoint a person to chair each hearing (“the chair”). \n6) The chair must determine the procedure that is to govern that hearing. \n7) The chair must make arrangements for a public hearing to begin with an explanation of— \n\ta) the proposals with which the hearing is concerned; \n\tb) how representations about the proposals may be made. \n8) The chair must allow representations to be made— \n\ta) by each political party that is registered under Part 2 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) and either— \n\t\ti) has at least one Member of the Senedd, or \n\t\tii) received at least 10% of the votes cast in the most recent general election; \n\tb) by any other person considered by the chair to have an interest in any of the proposals with which the hearing is concerned (subject to subsection (9)(c)). \n9) The chair may— \n\ta) determine the order in which representations are made; \n\tb) restrict the amount of time allowed for representations and need not allow the same amount to each person; \n\tc) if necessary because of shortage of time, determine which of the persons mentioned in subsection (8)(b) are not allowed to make representations. \n10) The chair may put questions, or allow questions to be put, to a person making representations at the hearing. \n11) If questions are allowed to be put, the chair may regulate the manner of questioning or restrict the number of questions a person may ask. \n\nSection 49H) **Second report on boundary review and final period for representations**\n\n1) At the end of the second period for representations the Commission must— \n\ta) consider its proposals having regard to the representations made during the first and second periods for representations, and \n\tb) if\u200d, having considered its proposals, it intends to make a proposal that was not set out in the initial report relating to the name of a Senedd constituency— \n\t\ti) consult the Welsh Language Commissioner on the orthography of the proposed name, and \n\t\tii) have regard to any representations made by the Commissioner on the orthography of the proposed name. \n2) After taking the steps in subsection (1), the Commission must make a second report—\u200d \n\ta) setting out— \n\t\ti) the Commission’s proposals for change to the boundaries and names of the Senedd constituencies, or \n\t\tii) if the Commission does not consider any change appropriate, a statement to

Commission must— \n\ta) publish the second report, \n\tb) publish a document— \n\t\ti) containing records of the public hearings held under section 49G, and \n\t\tii) setting out any representations (of the kind described in section 49F(2)(b)) received during the second period for representations, \n\tc) inform any person it considers appropriate of how to access the report and the document published under paragraph (b), \n\td) invite representations—\u200d \n\t\ti) on the report\u200d, \n\t\tii) in respect of any representations made during the public hearings, and \n\t\tiii) in respect of any representations (of the kind described in section 49F(2)(b)) received during the second period for representations, and \n\te) notify any person it considers appropriate of the final period for

A Member State wishing to introduce the GRCM shall comply with all of the following conditions: \n\ta) it had in 2014, in accordance with the method and figures set out in the 2016 final report dated 23\xa0August 2016 on the VAT gap published by the Commission, a VAT gap, expressed as a percentage of the VAT total tax liability, of at least 5 percentage points above the Community median VAT gap; \n\tb) it has, based on the impact assessment that accompanied the legislative proposal for this Article, a carousel fraud level within its total VAT gap of more than 25\xa0%; \n\tc) it establishes that other control measures are not sufficient to combat carousel fraud on its territory, in particular by specifying the control measures applied and the particular reasons for their lack of effectiveness, as well as the reasons why administrative cooperation in the field of VAT has proven insufficient; \n\td) it establishes that the estimated gains in tax compliance and collection expected as a result of the introduction of the GRCM outweigh the expected overall additional burden on businesses and tax authorities by at least 25\xa0%; and \n\te) it establishes that the introduction of the GRCM will not result in businesses and tax authorities incurring costs that are higher than those incurred as a result of the application of other control measures. The Member State shall attach to the request referred to in paragraph 3 the calculation of the VAT gap according to the method and figures available in the report on the VAT gap published by the Commission, as referred to in point (a) of the second subparagraph of this paragraph. \n2) Member States that apply the GRCM shall establish appropriate and effective electronic reporting obligations for all taxable persons and, in particular, for taxable persons who supply or receive goods or services to which the GRCM applies to ensure the effective functioning and monitoring of the application of the GRCM. \n3) Member States wishing to apply the GRCM shall submit a request to the Commission and provide the following information: \n\ta) a detailed justification of fulfilment of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1; \n\tb) the starting date of application of the GRCM and the period to be covered by the GRCM; \n\tc) actions to be taken to inform taxable persons of the introduction of the application of the GRCM; and \n\td) a detailed description of the accompanying measures referred to in paragraph 2. If the Commission considers that it does not have all the necessary information, it shall request additional information, including underlying methods, assumptions, studies and other supporting documents, within one month of receipt of the request.
