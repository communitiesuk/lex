By order of Mann J dated 6 August 2014 Mr Xu was required to deliver up the materials removed from the Claimants&#8217; premises in the Suitcase and the Secure Notebook, prohibited from using or copying any technical or confidential information relating to the Claimants&#8217; business, prohibited from leaving the jurisdiction and required to surrender his passport.

It emerged in the civil proceedings that in the period leading up to and immediately following his departure from the UK Mr Xu arranged for the personal delivery of a number of computers and other electronic devices into the custody of his parents in China.  His parents-in-law and his wife had acted as couriers to transport other computers and electronic storage equipment out of the UK and from Hong Kong to mainland China.  In Hong Kong he was observed carrying a metallic rectangular item, later assessed by the Claimants to have been his personal laptop, and was later seen passing a shoulder bag to his wife.  </p>

In his basis of plea Mr Xu said that of the 55 strategies, only 29 were live: 26 were not in use.  He accepted the strategies were useful and valuable to him.  He could use the bank of ideas as a way of promoting his career elsewhere.  He would have been able to produce similar or adapted strategies, piggy-backing on Claimants&#8217; models, so as to succeed more quickly and to a higher degree than otherwise.  </p>

Sentencing Mr Xu, HHJ Tomlinson said that this was a grave abuse of trust on his part.  It was fraudulent activity carried out over a sustained period of time, with significant planning.  The offence involves in very simple language the misappropriation of intellectual property.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition he was made the subject of a Serious Crime Prevention Order (&#8220;SCPO&#8221;).  By the SCPO Mr Xu was required to deliver up all copies of the company&#8217;s intellectual property within his possession or control and disclose all third parties to whom he had allowed possession of or access to the confidential information and the location of any copies.  He was prevented from using the strategies anywhere in the world.  Confiscation proceedings were also commenced.  </p>

The charges were that he had failed without reasonable excuse (1) to deliver up all copies of the intellectual property (Count 1); (2) to deliver up all physical devices on which copies of the intellectual property have at any time been stored (Count 2); (3) to deliver up all physical devices which were used by him to remotely access the Claimants&#8217; system (Count 3); (4) to disclose as required the fact that he had allowed third parties, namely his wife, mother, father, mother-in-law and/or father-in-law to possess or access the intellectual property (Count 4); and (5) to disclose as required the details of all the locations of all copies of the intellectual property (Count 5).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 January 2017 Mr Xu was convicted at Southwark Crown Court of two counts (Counts 4 and 5) on the indictment.  He was acquitted on the delivery up counts (presumably, as Mr Michael Fordham QC, for the Claimants, suggests, on the basis there was doubt either as to whether the computers that had been used to access the systems were still in existence at the relevant time, or if they did exist, on the issue as to whether Mr Xu had possession or control over them, all of which he contested).  By their verdicts of guilty, the jury rejected Mr Xu&#8217;s denial of having taken copies of the Claimants&#8217; intellectual property.  On 20 January 2017 he was sentenced to a further 18 months&#8217; imprisonment, to run concurrently with the earlier four-year sentence.  Sentencing Mr Xu on 20 January 2017 HHJ Griffiths said: &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t made it clear, I think that I wouldn&#8217;t have reached the same verdicts as the jury on 1, 2 and 3&#8221; (Transcript, Day 12, page 25, lines 3-6).  Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal observed on 10 February 2017, rejecting Mr Xu&#8217;s application for leave to appeal against sentence on the papers, certifying it as totally without merit, Judge Griffiths &#8220;had to determine the basis of sentence in a way which was faithful to the verdicts of the jury and did so in a way which was favourable, perhaps overly so, to [Mr Xu]&#8221;.  </p>

The subject matter of the request for recall is not the conduct that was on the indictment for the SCPO breaches.  The Crown Court at the SCPO breach trial was not dealing with the question of recall, and its sentence of further imprisonment was in respect of the SCPO breaches.  The Crown Court could only sentence in respect of those breaches.  The Crown Court was not saying that Mr Xu did not need to be recalled to custody.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Tam submits that Miss Begum&#8217;s letter of reply does not contain a decision not to recall Mr Xu; rather it consists of a general explanation of how the system of recall works.  She was not required, he submits, to embark on the process of deciding whether or not to &#8220;seek&#8221; (i.e. initiate) the recall of Mr Xu for four reasons: first, not every instance of alleged misbehaviour by an offender can require the SSJ to turn his mind to recall, with all the resource implications that such would entail.  The Claimants are third parties to the decision-making in Mr Xu&#8217;s case, and even on the matters put forward by them recall of Mr Xu was not the only rational conclusion which could be reached.  Second, nothing in Allen &amp; Overy&#8217;s letter required the SSJ to recall, given the test of breach of licence condition, a necessity for recall.  The breaches of the SCPO occurred before the licence conditions were imposed.  The conduct about which the Claimants complain occurred in the course of the criminal proceedings.  Such matters could be reflected in the view taken by the Crown Court of the seriousness of Mr Xu&#8217;s offending and of whether anything, and if so what, could be said on his behalf in mitigation.  If the conduct of his defence amounted to a contempt of court, that was for the court to assess and deal with.  Third, the SSJ was under a duty to release Mr Xu at the half way point of his sentence and was only required to consider recall if there were sufficient grounds for doing so, namely, because he could no longer be managed safely in the community subject to a licence condition (PSI30/2014, para 2.3).  Fourth, he had breached the SCPO and received a prison sentence for that breach, but it was not suggested that the SCPO was ineffective.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fordham responds to the suggestion that any decision on whether Mr Xu would be recalled was not for Ms Begum to make, by saying that is no answer.  She is the decision maker at the gateway.  She has a duty, Mr Fordham submits, to decide whether or not to initiate the recall process (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Cityhook Ltd) v OFT</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2009/57" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 57 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 57 (Admin)</ref>, per Foskett J at para 176).  Without a positive decision from her, that is the end of the matter.  That is correct.  However Mr Tam submits she is not required to make a decision as to whether or not to institute the recall process in every case.  There is no authority to which I have been referred for the proposition that a request by a victim to initiate a recall that is not acceded to is a reviewable decision.  I accept Mr Tam&#8217;s submission that it is only if the decision not to institute the process is irrational that the decision is judicially reviewable.  Mr Tam referred to the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v General Council of the Bar ex parte Percival</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 QB 212" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 QB 212</ref> at 234C-F per Watkins LJ which, albeit in a different context, provides some support for his submission as to the basis on which the non-decision in the present case can be challenged.  </p>

The decision not to institute the recall process is not, on the evidence, irrational.  The breaches of the SCPO pre-dated the licence, so they do not amount to breaches of the licence conditions.  As for Mr Xu&#8217;s misconduct during the course of the trial, which is the real matter which the Claimants contend justified a recall, I agree with Mr Tam that what happened was commonplace in criminal trials.  They could have been dealt with in the proceedings or ancillary to them.  I do not consider that it could be said that it was necessary to recall Mr Xu on the basis of his conduct, in particular with the SCPO in place.  In any event this is not a case where a recall would result in Mr Xu remaining in prison until August 2018.  He would be eligible for a fixed term recall which would lead to his release in 28 days or less; if his recall was a standard recall the Parole Board would consider his case after 28 days.  </p>

The factors to which I have had regard in concluding that in the circumstances there was no requirement for the SSJ to consider recall apply equally to the situation now under consideration, namely that the SSJ was required to consider recall.  Applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Calder</span> test, in particular the requirement that it was necessary to recall Mr Xu, I consider it to be clear on the evidence that it is highly likely, at the very least, that the outcome of the SSJ&#8217;s consideration would have been that he would not have been recalled.   He was serving a significant prison sentence at the time the Claimants sought his recall.  </p>

The guidance on offering contact to victims who do not meet the statutory criteria has recently been clarified in PI 03/2017 and your client does not meet the criteria under the discretionary scheme.  In any case, under the statutory or discretionary victim scheme, victims are not provided with a copy of an offender&#8217;s licence.  A victim will only be told about conditions which directly relate to them.  For example, if a condition was set for an offender not to contact a particular person that person would be told that the condition has been set.  The Secretary of State does not disclose information about offenders and how they are being managed unless it is necessary and can be justified in accordance with data protection principles.  Whilst it is appreciated your client was previously forwarded the licence that had been prepared for Mr Xu this would have been an error and any further licence will not be shared.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fordham submits that this is an exceptional case justifying discretionary contact under PI 03/2017.  The Claimants&#8217; case is that the offending against them is extremely serious and should not be minimised simply because they are a corporate rather than an individual victim, and the harm they have suffered is financial rather than physical or psychological.  Further, Mr Fordham submits that fairness requires that the SSJ, having previously provided details of the licence conditions imposed, do so again in analogous circumstances.  Knowing the outcome is essential.  He asks, by way of example, how can the Claimants know whether they have to make an application to the civil court for an order that Mr Xu&#8217;s passport not be returned to him if they do not know whether the SSJ has decided, following representations from the Claimants, whether further special licence conditions should include the surrender by Mr Xu of his passport.  The Claimants are entitled, he submits, in fairness (at common law) to know what the SSJ decided, whether the conditions they sought were included, and if not why not (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 AC 531" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 AC 531</ref> per Lord Mustill at 560-562).  Mr Fordham submits that there is no reason why the sort of information that was properly given to the Claimants in response to previous representations should be denied to them if and when representations relating to licence conditions are made on a future occasion.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject these submissions.  The witness statement of Mr Doherty, who at the material time was Head of Offender Management at HMP Wandsworth, explains that when the previous licence was sent to the Claimants that was done by mistake.  There is no challenge to PI 03/2017.  The SSJ has applied his policy and concluded that the Claimants do not qualify for the discretionary scheme.  What the Claimants, Mr Tam observes, are asking for, is to be in a better position even than the policy provides for statutory or discretionary victims.  No <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> challenge to this conclusion has been made out.  I agree with Mr Tam that if and in so far as the Claimants have been provided with information in the past beyond that to which they were entitled, such a past error does not entail the consequence that the SSJ is obliged to repeat the error in the future for the sake of consistency (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for Defence ex parte Wilkins</span> (CO/4676/2000)).  The present challenge is in any event premature.  The SSJ, Mr Tam says, does not know whether or not it will be appropriate to have any condition relating to the passport at the time the licence comes into force.  </p>

It would allow Mr Xu to avoid any supervision through the licence period which forms part of his sentence of imprisonment.  It would remove the effectiveness of the SCPO identified as appropriate by the Crown Court.  It would facilitate further criminal and civil wrongdoing by Mr Xu.  It would enable him not only to complete his original plan of getting the fruits of his wrongdoing beyond the jurisdiction of the English courts so as to exploit them unhindered by English law, but also to avoid the consequences of further wrongdoing and, indeed, his wrongdoing to date.  That, moreover, would be while Mr Xu is still serving a criminal sentence in the UK, while he could be in no better position than being subject to important licence conditions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the SSHD considered that the timing of a deportation order is a matter for her discretion under UKBA s.34, however this discretion should be exercised in a manner which is consistent with the wider statutory purpose.  In this regard (at para 5) she notes the following four points: (a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/30/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.32</ref> reflects Parliament&#8217;s settled view that it is in the public interest that foreign criminals are deported and (implicitly therefore) that they should not remain in the UK.  (b) There has already been a significant delay in the making of a deportation order in this case because of the earlier decision&#8212;made on an exceptional basis&#8212;to await the outcome of the application for a SCPO preventing Mr Xu from leaving the jurisdiction.  (c) A further (and important) purpose behind the statutory deportation provisions is to protect the UK population <span style="font-style:italic">as a whole</span> from the risk of further criminality resulting from that individual&#8217;s presence in the country.  The SSHD is satisfied that it is in the interests of the wider community that Mr Xu be deported as soon as possible (although she recognises that it is not in the interests of the Claimants and has taken full account of this in the exercise of her discretion).  (d) Mr Xu will shortly need to be released if deportation does not take place.  This will provide him with an opportunity to use his physical presence in the UK to commit offences against third parties in this country.  Whilst the risk of him committing further offences in the UK may be low, it is one from which Parliament intended the wider UK population to be protected.  </p>

Release would give rise to the real risk of him absconding and thereby frustrating his deportation from the UK.  Such an outcome would undermine public trust and confidence in the immigration system.  It is important that the SSHD demonstrates to the public that those whose offending renders them subject to the mandatory deportation provisions are in fact deported, as opposed to that individual disappearing.  This applies even if (as is likely in this case) the disappearance takes the form of returning to the country of origin (para 6).  </p>

She is prepared to accept for the purposes of this decision that there is a real risk that if Mr Xu returns to China, he will engage in further criminality and that, as a result, your client may suffer harm to its commercial well-being, albeit of a nature which is declining in severity with the passage of time.  &#8230;&#8221; </p>

Mr Fordham picks up on the use of the word &#8220;submissions&#8221; to describe the document headed &#8220;Secretary of State&#8217;s response to representations&#8221; and observes that is precisely what they are.  What is set out in that document is not the reasons of the decision makers but the external presentation of those reasons (see, by analogy, <span style="font-style:italic">Needham v Nursing and Midwifery Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/1141" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1141 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1141 (Admin)</ref>, per Sullivan J at para 13).  A further matter of concern is that there appear to have been discussions on 11 September 2017 relevant to the decision which are said to be covered by legal professional privilege.  The fact is, Mr Fordham submits, that the reasons given in the internal documents of 11 September 2017 that have been disclosed do not &#8220;stack up&#8221;.

Mr Tam explained that there were two strands to the decision making process: first, the conventional approach reflected in the internal documents of 11 September 2017 which involved consideration of whether Mr Xu was suggesting that he should not be deported; and second, that part of the decision making process which involved consideration of the Claimants&#8217; representations.  It was after both strands of the decision making process had been completed that the deportation order was signed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fordham acknowledges that the general public interest requires the deportation of Mr Xu; the question is when.  He submits that the timing of any deportation order is for the SSHD&#8217;s open discretion (see <span style="font-style:italic">Macdonald&#8217;s</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Immigration Law &amp; Practice in the UK</span> 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Ed, vol.1, para 16.18: &#8220;complete discretion as to timing&#8221;).  The exercise of the timing power falls, he submits, to be justified by reasons which relate to timing (see <span style="font-style:italic">Kiarie v SSHD</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/42" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 42</ref>, per Lord Wilson at paras 34-35).  Mr Fordham submits that the question as to the appropriate time is especially important where the individual is eager to leave the UK, would be free of the restrictions of the licence conditions if he left, would escape the civil process which is underway, and would be free from the SCPO restriction imposed by the criminal court.  An effective SCPO is premised on Mr Xu remaining in the UK &#8211; that is the public interest in not deporting him now.  The specific public interest that is engaged and justifies delaying deportation is the prevention of crime which in this case essentially involves protecting the Claimants.  </p>

I agree with Mr Tam that the understanding of the SSHD as to how the discretion in s.34 should be exercised is correct (see para 53 above).  Parliament has directed that foreign criminals such as Mr Xu must be deported.  It is not conducive to the public good that they remain in the UK.  Implicit in that is that, as Mr Tam puts it, the sooner that they go the better.  Accordingly, whilst the Secretary of State has a discretion as to the timing of a deportation that is only so that regard can be had to practical considerations.  The case management of an individual case may affect the precise timing of the deportation.  The discretion in s.34 does not give the SSHD the power to delay the date of deportation by months (or even years) for reasons suggested by the Claimants.  </p>

I do not accept that the SSHD has set up a false antithesis, as he contends.  The commercial interest is the public interest.  It is the Claimants who have focussed on their commercial interests.  The response, read as a whole, makes clear that the SSHD appreciates that the Claimants&#8217; interests are an aspect of the relevant &#8220;public interest&#8221;, and that the SSHD has properly balanced one aspect of the public interest, namely the Claimants&#8217; commercial interests, against the interests of the wider community.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fordham submits that the potential harm to the Claimants is vast, and that the SSHD has not appreciated the scale and seriousness of this.  He contends that to decide not to deport Mr Xu at this stage would mean a real protection and a very significantly reduced harm.  Mr Fordham refers to a detention review dated 29 September 2017 which includes an assessment of the risk of Mr Xu re-offending as &#8220;High, as he has breached his SCPO and it is considered he is highly likely to do this again&#8221;.  The SSJ and SSHD have ample authority and resources to monitor Mr Xu&#8217;s compliance: electronic monitoring or weekly reporting, for example, could be imposed.  If he deliberately acts contrary to his licence conditions, he can be recalled.  Accordingly it does not follow that the risk and harm are the same if Mr Xu is in the UK, and if he is in China.  The Claimants do not accept that he could clandestinely secure importation of copies of strategies stored on computers and currently located in China, and start exploiting them here.  That being so they take issue with the SSHD&#8217;s contention that if Mr Xu is released there is a very real risk that he will abscond and simply disappear within the UK or return to China.  Where there are, as here, powers that can control him, there is a strong public interest in not deporting him at this stage because of the serious risk of serious harm.  In these circumstances Mr Fordham submits that the decision to deport Mr Xu at the present time is not a reasonable exercise of discretionary power.</p>

Further the benefit value to Mr Xu does not indicate the level of harm to the Claimants if Mr Xu re-offends.

He also referred to the Victim Impact Statement of Mr Harlow, a director of the First Claimant, dated 2 July 2015, which under the heading &#8220;significant potential loss&#8221; says that &#8220;the risk of substantial loss to our business is very real&#8221;.  Mr Harlow says: &#8220;It is impossible for us to quantify the ultimate cost to our business of [Mr Xu&#8217;s] actions or to protect ourselves against the potentially catastrophic losses to which he has exposed us&#8221;.  Mr Fordham says that when Mr Xu is released from custody we can only assume he will be reunited with the strategies, which it is reasonable to assume are stored on the computer equipment he took with him when he fled to Hong Kong, which he still has not delivered up.  Mr Harlow estimated that over &#163;7.5million had been spent on protective measures in terms of investigations and enhanced security.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, as Mr Tam observes, there is an important distinction to be drawn between the value of the strategies (whether in 2014 when they were stolen or currently) and how much harm could be caused to the Claimants by misuse of the strategies now.  Mr Xu has not deprived the Claimants of the information itself; they have continued to use the information which they have modified and updated.   That makes the calculation of the possible future harm a very difficult question.  It is not possible to calculate with any precision the loss that may ensue if these strategies were to be misused.  The magnitude of the likely harm, Mr Tam comments, is very uncertain.  The A&amp;O representations assert that it may be &#8220;hundreds of millions of pounds of loss to the Claimants&#8221;.  However there is no indication, as Mr Tam observes, in the 44-page letter as to how this figure is arrived at.  Mr Caisley has given more detail in his latest witness statement.  At paragraph 17 he refers to a specific strategy, one of the Hadfield strategies.  A value has been given as part of a marginal simulation which is based on trading this particular strategy as part of the pool of other strategies which have been selected to work together to best advantage.  One question that arises is whether Mr Xu would have access to all of the other strategies, many of which the Claimants have amended.  </p>

However the Claimants have not explained how use of the original strategies would undermine the profitability of amended versions of the strategies now used by them; and (2) strategies are not used to trade on a stand alone basis.  Rather, trading decisions are determined by a pool of strategies which, in the case of the Claimants, include many which Mr Xu has never had access to.  It is unclear how any stand alone use of the strategies by Mr Xu, or even use of the strategies as part of a wider pool of competitive strategies would sufficiently mimic the trading decisions taken by the Claimants&#8217; current pool of strategies so as to reduce or destroy their profitability.    </p>

In addition he makes the point that the Claimants do not appear to have addressed the fact that the person whose interests are most directly affected by the deportation is Mr Xu.  He is a foreign national with no leave to be in the UK.  In those circumstances it is highly unlikely that he would be granted permission to work; that being so he will be in a state of limbo and the question arises as to whether the State will be obliged to provide him with care and accommodation.  In addition, as Mr Halim observes, if he is not permitted to leave the UK, he will be kept apart from his family in China; and all this, says Mr Halim, to serve the uncertain commercial interests of the Claimants.  By contrast, the Claimants, who are only indirectly affected by the decision, are able to take other steps to protect their position, which they have done through civil proceedings.  </p>

However, as Mr Tam observes, there is no logical reason why the Claimants are the only persons against whom Mr Xu may offend if he were able to do so.  There must be some risk of him re-offending and that risk cannot be limited to re-offending against the Claimants.  The SSHD was entitled in my view to proceed on the basis that Mr Xu represented a risk of criminal re-offending which did not target the Claimants.  However even if, as the Claimants contend, he poses no risk of harm to third parties that does not vitiate the public interest in his deportation.  What the Secretary of State has to do is strike a balance between all the considerations to which she must properly have regard, and form a view as to whether deportation is in the public interest or not.  That she has done.  She has, in my judgment, properly considered and balanced the competing public interests, the public interest in deporting a foreign criminal and the interests of the Claimants identified in their representations which also form, as she accepts, part of the public interest.  In so doing she has assessed and taken into account the risk of harm to the Claimants&#8217; commercial interests.  </p>

In practical terms therefore: (1) whatever benefit value is placed on the strategies the Claimants would suffer a risk of such a loss of profitability if through Mr Xu&#8217;s actions the strategies became known to the world (and it would only be a risk).  (2) Mr Xu and/or his prospective employer would only be able to profit from the strategies if they prevent them from becoming widely available.  Consequently, Mr Xu would have every incentive not to disseminate the strategies further.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The point that was made [was] that no undertaking had been given in the context of these proceedings that Mr Xu&#8217;s passport would not be returned to him.  This remains the position (and for the avoidance of doubt, although this [is] not deemed necessary, this letter should be treated as confirmation of a change of circumstances referred to in the letter of November 2016).  Mr Xu is subject to a deportation order which requires him to leave the UK. If he is released and requests the return of his passport to comply with the terms of the deportation order this request will be considered in light of the circumstances appertaining at the relevant time.  It is a matter for your clients to contact those acting for Mr Xu to seek their agreement to notify you of any request for the return of the passport that is made on behalf of Mr Xu.  Unless my client receives confirmation directly from Mr Xu or his representatives that he does not object to my client notifying you of the request for and decision as to the return of the passport, my client does not consider it appropriate to notify you of such events.&#8221;  </p>

On 15 May 2017 the GLD replied on behalf of the SSJ asking why such a confirmation was now being sought.  Mr Fordham says that the issue was thereby left open, and that it crystallized upon the SSHD&#8217;s decision of 28 September 2017.  </p>

It would follow, he contends, (just as it followed at the stage of interim relief: see my judgment at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2017/2555" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2555 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2555 (Admin)</ref> at para 6) that the order of the court may not lawfully be undermined by their action facilitating his voluntary exit from the UK.  </p>

I agree with Mr Tam that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/19/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.17</ref> does not confer a power on the SSHD in effect to impound an individual&#8217;s passport for other purposes, such as to prevent the voluntary departure from the UK of an individual whom she is not proposing herself to remove from the UK.  The Claimants want the SSHD to hold Mr Xu&#8217;s passport in order to prevent him leaving the UK.  That, Mr Tam submits, and I agree, would be an exercise of the power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/19/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.17</ref> for an unlawful purpose.  </p>
