On 10 September 2017, I granted permission to apply for judicial review on all grounds (except paragraph 31a of the Claimant&#8217;s Statement of Facts and Grounds which had been abandoned), on the basis that, in this particular case, it was necessary for those matters to be resolved before any redetermination took place.</p>

At the substantive hearing before me, Mr Richard Turney, who appeared on behalf of the Claimant, submitted that this further decision letter was still open to challenge on part of ground 2 and applied to amend the claim to enable the court to review that aspect.  Ms Isabella Tafur did not object to that application.  No formal amendments of the Claim were put before the Court, but I accepted that the matter could be dealt with by oral submissions on both sides directed to the matters raised in paragraph 41a to 41c of the Claimant&#8217;s skeleton.  </p>

It is said that the Claimant obtained an option for a lease of the site from the owner.  On 28 June 2013, the Claimant applied to the local planning authority, South Kesteven District Council (&#8220;SKDC&#8221;), for planning permission for a wind turbine development.  The Claimant appealed against SKDC&#8217;s refusal of permission to the Defendant.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal was dealt with by way of written representations.  Following a site visit, the Inspector issued his decision letter on 20 January 2015 dismissing the appeal.  He said that there were four issues.  In relation to the first issue, the effect of the development on the historic environment, he concluded that the development would harm the setting and significance of the Knights Templar preceptory, a scheduled ancient monument, and of St Mary&#8217;s Church, North Witham, a Grade I listed building, albeit that the harm would be &#8220;less than substantial&#8221;.  The proposal therefore conflicted with policy EN1 of the South Kesteven Core Strategy.  Furthermore, paragraph 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework (&#8220;NPPF&#8221;) required the &#8220;less than substantial harm&#8221; to be weighed against the benefits of the proposal.  On the second issue, the Inspector concluded that the proposal would have a significant adverse effect on the outlook from two residential properties so as to conflict with Policy EN1 of the Core Strategy.  The third issue related to the environmental benefit of the proposal as a renewable energy development.  The Inspector attached &#8220;some weight&#8221; to the offsetting of the effects of climate change by the production of about <span style="font-style:italic">170,000 kWh</span> of renewable energy.  Under the fourth issue, the overall planning balance, the Inspector decided that the &#8220;limited benefits of the wind energy development&#8221; did not outweigh the &#8220;less than substantial harm&#8221; to the two heritage assets and the significant adverse effect upon residential amenity.  That conclusion led him to dismiss the appeal.  The Inspector referred to an objection which had been made by the Ministry of Defence (&#8220;MoD&#8221;) on the grounds of unacceptable interference to air traffic control radars at RAF Wittering, but reached no conclusion on that aspect.  </p>

On 4 March 2015, PINS acknowledged the error but somewhat strangely filed an Acknowledgment of Service on 12 March 2015 stating that the claim would be defended.  It was not until 14 June 2015 that the Defendant conceded that the decision on the appeal should be quashed. A consent order was sealed on 7 July 2015.</p>

They pointed out that the second Inspector might not reach a different overall conclusion.  On the same date, PINS stated that redetermination appeals are treated as a priority and so every effort would be made to ensure that the Claimant&#8217;s appeal would be dealt with in &#8220;a timely manner&#8221;.  From then on the Claimant and its Solicitors continued to explain to PINS why the redetermination needed to take place urgently.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16 July 2015 both the Claimant and SKDC notified PINS that no further information would be submitted on the appeal.  Although the second Inspector carried out his site visit on 29 September 2015, his decision letter was not issued until 14 December 2015.  He allowed the appeal.  He reached rather different judgments to the first Inspector.  He concluded that the proposal would not have any harmful impact on any heritage asset (and therefore paragraph 134 of the NPPF was not engaged at all), there would be no detrimental impact upon residential amenity, no material effect upon radar or the use of RAF Wittering, the amount of renewable energy which would be produced carried &#8220;significant weight&#8221; and so the appeal should be allowed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, by the time the second decision letter was issued, substantial changes had been made to the Feed-in Tariff Scheme.  First, BEIS&#8217;s predecessor had decided that the level of tariff should be reduced substantially.  For example, in January 2016 the rate payable was approximately half that payable between October and December 2015. Second, with effect from 1 October 2015, the Department removed an operator&#8217;s ability to become pre-accredited under the scheme so as to secure a particular level of tariff.  The Claimant contends that by September 2015 it had met all the essential requirements for proceeding with the Honeypot Lane scheme except for obtaining planning permission, and that it was because permission had not been granted by that stage that the Claimant lost the ability to secure a favourable tariff of at least 12.49p per kWh.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 December 2015 the Claimant applied for an ex gratia payment under PINS scheme.  The Claimant contended that if the First Inspector had not made an error in his decision, it would have been possible for the Claimant to obtain pre-accreditation at a guaranteed generation tariff rate of 12.05p per kWh, whereas, following the Government&#8217;s decision to re-introduce pre-accreditation on 8 February 2016, the Claimant was only able to obtain a guaranteed generation tariff of 5.46p.  This formed the basis for the main item of the claim. The difference between the two rates applied to future production over a 20 year period was said to involve a loss of &#163;2,364,650.  However, this claim was expressed in purely nominal terms.  It made no attempt to discount these projected future cash flows using an appropriate risk rate, (nor did it address any difference in expenses attributable to the higher tariff rate).  The claim also included some other items of loss relating to various costs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequently, the Claimant submitted to PINS a report by a Chartered Surveyor at Fisher German LLP dated 26 September 2016 on the market value of the company&#8217;s leasehold interest in the development site in three different scenarios. Section 3 of the report described the nature of the Claimant&#8217;s interest in the site.  It appears that Heads of Terms were signed on 20 October 2014 giving the Claimant exclusivity &#8220;until the signing of the Option Agreement&#8221; subject to a 12 months longstop and &#8220;unspecified extension provisions&#8221;.  The lease, if granted, was to commence 6 months after the grant of planning permission and pre-accreditation &#8220;being agreed&#8221;.  The valuer was instructed that the option had not been exercised, but the &#8220;Heads of Terms remain applicable and in place with the Landlord&#8221;.  He added that although he had seen no evidence that the Heads of Terms were legally binding, he assumed that they were (paragraph 3.6).  No point appears to have been taken about these matters and, although they should be noted, they do not inhibit the court in determining the issues which have been raised in this claim by the parties. The expert valued the Claimant&#8217;s assumed leasehold interest by reference to the projected future net income stream and by using discounting techniques (see paragraph 15.1). As Mr Turney accepted, the valuer arrived at a substantially lower figure than had previously been advanced.  Plainly, material of this nature would need to be tested, but all that must be subject to the question of legal principle which this claim raises. </p>

Whether or not it has been explicitly set out in the superseded scheme or new policy, the Planning Inspectorate&#8217;s scheme has always been to consider actual costs that are directly related to an acknowledged error.  The Planning Inspectorate has been consistent in rejecting claims for loss of earning or loss of profit.  In redetermination cases, our guiding principle has been to consider reimbursing costs involved in the reviewing and updating of evidence essential to the reconsideration of the remitted appeal and any additional work undertaken following any relevant policy and legislative changes that occurred from the date the first decision was quashed.  Our policy states that ex gratia payments are designed to restore the wronged party to the position they would have been in before the error occurred.  The scheme clearly refers throughout to reasonable wasted costs or expenses incurred as a result of an acknowledged error.  It does not refer to loss of earnings or loss of profit, since they are not recognised as wasted costs because they are not directly attributable to an Inspector error in decision-making in the same way as, for example, professional fees incurred from needing to revise evidence for a redetermination appeal or the reasonable travel and subsistence expenses associated with attending a further appeal Hearing.  Conversely, loss of earnings is posited here as potential future profit which cannot be guaranteed or demonstrated as a direct wasted cost&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It cannot simply be deduced that except for this error, the appellant would have secured planning permission for the proposed development in January 2015, irrespective of the decision of the second Inspector to grant planning permission.  The first Inspector had refused permission having considered the main issues, being the effect of the proposal on the historic environment and residential amenity, as well as the environmental benefit of the renewable energy development and the overall planning balance.  It was not a ground of challenge in the claim that the Inspector erred in his reasoning on the main issues and it similarly went untested as to whether the Inspector would have reached the same conclusion on the main issues, had this error in calculation not occurred.  Thus, it is possible that permission may still have been refused by the Inspector and it would have been for the High Court to judge whether the Inspector had erred in his reasoning on the main issues in circumstances where such grounds of challenge had been brought.  Our revised policy for ex gratia payments has clarified that where the Secretary of State decided, on the basis of legal advice, not to defend a challenge brought and submits to the Court&#8217;s judgment, we will consider what went wrong and whether an ex gratia payment in respect of the costs of the redetermination is appropriate.  There is nothing in the former policy that limits or prohibits us from applying the same principle.  It is only accepted that the error caused the appeal to be remitted for reconsideration, therefore, only deliberation of reimbursing reasonable and proportionate additional costs directly arising from the redetermination process fall to be considered. Loss of earnings, as asserted here, is not considered to be a reasonable or proportionate &#8220;cost&#8221; that can be said to directly arise from the redetermination process.&#8221;</p>

However, where a pattern develops, and a number of similar cases need to be dealt with, it may be sensible to set up as an extra-statutory scheme.  Financial remedies should be fair, reasonable and proportionate to the damage suffered by a complainant.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turney relies upon two passages in PINS&#8217; scheme which repeat a statement made in HM Treasury&#8217;s document, namely that the aim is to return or restore the complainant to the position they would have been in had the agency acted correctly.  I deal with the application of that statement to the circumstances of the present case in the next section of this judgment.  By itself the language used does not say anything about the nature of the compensation that may be provided and, in particular, whether it includes or excludes compensation for loss of earnings or loss of profits.  That is not surprising because the Treasury document merely says that the &#8220;restoration objective&#8221; is something which an agency &#8220;should consider&#8221; &#8220;as far as reasonably possible.&#8221;  It does not contain an absolute commitment to &#8220;restoration&#8221; in all circumstances. It expects that an agency will &#8220;design&#8221; a scheme having regard to the more detailed guidance and examples which follow.  Paragraph A4.14.12 of &#8220;Managing Public Money&#8221; warns that schemes &#8220;must be well designed since costs can escalate if a problem turns out to be more extensive than initially expected&#8221;.  Box A4.14B expects an agency to &#8220;set clear scheme rules with supporting guidance, to implement the policy intention&#8221; and &#8220;to make the remedies fair and proportionate&#8221;. In my judgment satisfying one aspect of the &#8220;restoration&#8221; objective is an obvious pre-requisite for an ex gratia compensation scheme. A citizen cannot legitimately expect that public funds be used to put him in a <span style="font-style:italic">better</span> position than if the error had not been committed.  But reading PINS&#8217; scheme as a whole, it is plain that the restoration objective is not the sole criterion by which claims for ex gratia payments are to be determined.</p>

Thus far, PINS scheme does not hold out the possibility of awarding compensation for loss of profits or earnings.</p>

The reference to &#8220;goodwill&#8221; has nothing to do with the term used in accounting or corporate finance referring to a value of a business as a going concern.  The phrase &#8220;a goodwill payment&#8221; indicates a payment referable to a helpful, friendly, kindly or benevolent attitude (Oxford English Dictionary). Accordingly, the section of the document dealing with the determination of the claim does not indicate that payments will be made for loss of earnings or profits.  Instead, the scheme is said to cover costs (or expenditure) which have been incurred.</p>

The word &#8220;compensation&#8221; is neutral.  By itself it does not indicate the nature of any compensation which may be paid.  The Claimant then suggests that the phrase &#8220;costs suffered&#8221; can reasonably be said to refer to a citizen asking himself &#8220;what has this error cost me?&#8221; which could cover a loss, such as a loss of profit.  Even taking that phrase by itself, I think that Mr Turney seeks to invest the language with more meaning than it can properly have for a scheme which provides for ex gratia payments.  In any event, when the document is read objectively and as a whole, it is plain that the scheme does not cover losses which go beyond expenditure incurred as a result of an error or failing.  It does not include a loss of profits or earnings, whether in the past or the future. The document contains no indication that the scheme provides compensation for an adverse effect on the profitability of the development of a site resulting from a mistake in the decision-making process.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is helpful to consider how the &#8220;restoration&#8221; objective would apply in the Claimant&#8217;s case and similar cases in any event.  The aim would be to put the Claimant in the position in which he would have been if the error had not occurred.  Here, the sole error made by the Inspector was to misunderstand or misstate the estimated output of the wind turbine. He made an error about the information before him which he then took into account in his decision on whether or not to grant permission.  So in order to correct <span style="font-style:italic">that error</span>, the Claimant was entitled to a determination of its appeal which used the correct output figure.  The first determination of the planning appeal was not quashed on the grounds of irrationality, such that the only lawful outcome of the appeal would have been a grant of planning permission.  Since most planning appeals involve the application of judgment to a number of issues, on each of which different decision-makers might rationally come to different views, and might strike the overall planning balance in different ways (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Newsmith Stainless Steels Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] PTSR 1126" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] PTSR 1126</ref></span> paragraph 6-7), it is difficult to see how it could be claimed that an error in the making of a planning decision deprived a complainant of an <span style="font-style:italic">entitlement</span> to a grant of planning permission if that error had not been committed.  That begs the question whether planning permission would necessarily have been granted on the information and evidence placed before the decision-maker.</p>

Where, however, the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Simplex</span> test is not satisfied, a public law error resulting in the quashing of the decision will lead to the appeal being re-determined.

That argument is, with respect, fallacious. In some cases an appeal might be successful on a redetermination because of a subsequent change in circumstances (for example, a new planning policy or new evidence) which favours a grant of permission.  There is no procedure in practice for determining what would have happened if the appeal had been re-determined on the same evidence as had been presented originally.</p>

But the Claimant&#8217;s argument nevertheless remains fallacious. The present case illustrates the point very well.  Even if the first Inspector had not committed the error on  output, there is no logical reason to think that he would have reached any different conclusions as regards the adverse effects of the proposal upon heritage assets and residential amenity.  The only issue is whether he might have decided to strike the overall planning balance differently and grant permission, on the basis that the benefits of the proposal (correctly assessed) outweighed that combined harm.  But, it is quite possible that he would have come to the same overall conclusion and dismissed the appeal.  It is also possible that other Inspectors might have reached similar conclusions on harm resulting from the proposed development and how the overall balance should be struck. </p>

Once the consent order was made on 7 July 2015 it then took over 5 months for the second appeal decision to be issued, albeit that the parties did not rely upon any additional evidence and no public inquiry or hearing needed to be held.  The Claimant says that it ought to have been possible for the second appeal decision to have been issued in good time for the Claimant to rely upon the pre-accreditation procedure, before it was temporarily brought to an end at the beginning of October 2015.</p>

(It should also be noted that the Claimant did not place any reliance upon anything contained in pre-action protocol letters). Furthermore, even if there was &#8220;fault&#8221; in this respect, this alternative argument still faces two insuperable hurdles.  First, the claim was for loss of profits falling outside the scope of the scheme, and not for additional expenditure attributable to the delay.  Second, the argument still assumes that if the redetermination had taken place by say August 2015, the appeal would have been allowed and planning permission granted.

But there is no evidence to indicate that PINS has unlawfully applied its ex gratia scheme in a blanket fashion or has been unwilling to consider a submission that there is a sufficient justification for compensation too be provided on an exceptional basis outside the scheme.

In view of the Claimant&#8217;s acceptance that it did not put forward an &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; case, there was no obligation on PINS to address that subject in its decision letter (see e.g. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R (Plant) v Lambeth LBC <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] PTSR 453" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] PTSR 453</ref></span> at paragraphs 62-63).</p>

The first sentence refers to the general principle that a person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of property.  The second sentence sets out the principle that a person shall not be deprived of his possessions save in the public interest and subject to relevant legal conditions. &#8220;Deprivation&#8221; refers to either a formal or a <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> expropriation of property.  The latter involves an examination of the realities of the situation, rather than its mere appearance, to see whether the rights in question (e.g. rights to dispose of and use property) have ceased to have any substance.  The third sentence recognises that a State is entitled to control the use of property in accordance with the public interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for that purpose (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sporrong</span> at paragraphs 61 to 63).  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sporrong</span> illustrates how the three rules may be applied. The case was concerned with &#8220;expropriation permits&#8221; which authorised a local authority to expropriate properties in the future and had the effect in the meantime of prohibiting construction work by the landowner.  The permits remained in force for 23 years in one case and 8 years in the other. During that time no domestic remedy was available to the landowner to mitigate the effect of blight, to reduce the duration of the permits or to obtain compensation.  The court held that this regime did not breach the second rule in A1P1 as no actual or <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> expropriation had taken place (paragraphs 62 to 63).  Because the permits were not designed to control the use of the property affected but were simply an &#8220;initial step&#8221; in a procedure leading to deprivation of possessions, the third rule was not engaged (paragraph 65).  But the court did find that because the blighting effect of the permits rendered the landowners&#8217; rights of property both precarious and defeasible, and substantially restricted their right to use their possessions, the first rule in A1P1 was engaged (paragraphs 59-60).  Ultimately, the court decided that the rule was violated because, given the absence of remedies to seek a reduction in the duration of the permits or compensation, a fair balance had not been struck between the general interest and the protection of the owner&#8217;s property rights (paragraphs 69 to 74).</p>

The <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pine Valley</span> case was only concerned with the <span style="font-style:italic">invalidation</span> of a planning permission which the landowner had previously been granted (paragraphs 51 to 54).  The case was therefore dealt with under the third rule in A1P1 (paragraph 56). The court held that the annulment of the permission was justified and not disproportionate in achieving a proper planning purpose, the preservation of a green belt. On that basis A1P1 had not been breached (paragraphs 57 to 59).</p>

In 1972 the Dutch Parliament introduced legislation to regulate the profession of accountants which required the applicants to obtain a registration as a &#8220;certified accountant&#8221; by (inter alia) satisfying various competency requirements.  The Court held that the appeal process against refusal of registration had not provided a fair hearing by an independent tribunal and was therefore in breach of Article 6.  The Court also held that the drop in the income and value of each of the applicants&#8217; businesses was an interference with an asset in the nature of a private right, or possession, and therefore in breach of A1P1.  It is clear from paragraph 41 of the decision that this conclusion was based upon the pre-existing client base which each of the applicants had built up through having practised as an accountant over a number of years.</p>

Merely capitalising and expressing an anticipated future income stream as a net present value does not demonstrate a loss of goodwill.  The claimed loss related to a future business on the Honeypot Lane site which had not yet produced any profit.  The fact that the Claimant had previously started to operate a wind turbine project on another site in Wales is nothing<span style="font-weight:bold"/>to the point.  Not surprisingly, the Claimant did not suggest to PINS, or to the Court, that any of the economic performance on the Welsh site was in any way relevant to the future income stream on the second site.  The business on the Welsh site was not analogous to a pre-existing customer base related to the Honeypot Lane site. For these reasons alone ground 4 must fail.</p>

It has to be accepted that the State is entitled to control the use and development of land in the public interest. Accordingly, a mere refusal of planning permission does not amount to an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions under the first rule in A1P1. Furthermore, simply making a mistake in the exercise of planning control, even one which is required to be corrected, does not alter that analysis, <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> where the correction of that mistake either may, or may not, result in the same outcome.

In my judgment, the reference to a &#8220;goodwill payment&#8221; for hardship or injustice is not intended to provide a back-door route to enable a claim which falls outside the ex gratia scheme, namely a loss of profits, to be pursued, or some variation of that claim.

These fees were dealt with as items 12, 13, 15 and 18 in the decision letter dated 4 April 2017. Mr Turney rightly accepted that this part of ground 3 stands or falls with ground 1. Since I have rejected ground 1, I must also reject this particular challenge.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Paragraph 44c is concerned with the Claimant&#8217;s loss of consultancy fees through needing to spend time on the redetermination of his planning appeal. The sum claimed was &#163;3,210. Mr Turney submitted that PINS failed to deal with this item in its decision letters. I accept Miss Tafur&#8217;s response that this item was in fact dealt with at page 8 of the decision letter dated 4 April 2017, where it was rejected for lack of supporting evidence to substantiate the claim. </p>
