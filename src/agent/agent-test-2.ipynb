      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Court Judgment Summaries:\n",
      "The case record ([2020] UKSC 35) and relevant sections reveal:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Divorce and Pension Transfer**:\n",
      "   - Mrs. Staveley divorced in 2000. The settlement involved transferring her share from the company pension scheme established during her marriage (with Morayford Ltd) into a \"section 32 buyout policy.\"\n",
      "   - This policy had a clause that any unutilized funds in the pension upon her death would return to the company, potentially benefitting her ex-husband, which she found unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "   *“...her share of the company pension scheme be transferred to her...However, given the level of her salary with the company, the pension was over-funded, and, as things stood then, any surplus in the fund on her death would be returned to the company, potentially benefitting her ex-husband.”* ([UKSC 35, para 21](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2020/35-21))\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Final Transfer Before Death (PPP)**:\n",
      "   - In late 2006, Mrs. Staveley transferred her pension funds to a personal pension plan (PPP), nominating her two sons to potentially receive death benefits.\n",
      "   - She asserted no personal use or benefits during life from this policy. Posthumously, her sons received these funds upon the discretion of the pension scheme administrator.\n",
      "\n",
      "   *“On 30 October 2006, she set in train the transfer of her section 32 policy to the PPP... A death benefit was payable, under the PPP, to...[her] sons in mid-2007.”* ([UKSC 35, paras 25-28](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2020/35-25))\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inheritance Tax Dispute**:\n",
      "   - Her actions triggered HMRC’s view under Section 3 IHTA 1984 that her transfers constituted lifetime transfers taxable under inheritance law obligations.\n",
      "   - At the crux was whether omitting benefit withdrawal and death-based fund allocation constituted dispositions taxable as estate-benefit allocations.\n",
      "\n",
      "   *“HMRC determined that inheritance tax...was due, on the basis that both the transfer into the PPP and her omission to draw benefits before death constituted taxable arrangements.”* ([UKSC 35, para 1](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2020/35-1))\n",
