      "   - Reports are required every two months during the Act's substantive operational period.\n",
      "   - Reports must be laid before Parliament. If a report is not prepared and published within 7 days after the reporting period ends, the Secretary of State must provide a written statement explaining the delay and publish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reports on International Environmental Protection Legislation (s.21)**:\n",

      "   - These reports must be laid before Parliament and published as soon as reasonably practicable after the reporting period ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulations Regarding Annual Returns on Conservation Covenants (s.136)**:\n",
      "   - The Secretary of State may create regulations around the annual returns that designated bodies must submit concerning conservation covenants they oversee.\n",
      "   - The Secretary of State has the power to direct periods and deadlines for these returns and must take reasonable steps to inform affected bodies of such directions.\n",
      "   - Regulations must be made through the negative procedure and may include general or specific provisions related to particular designated bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "These duties ensure that the Secretary of State maintains accountability for non-devolved climate change provisions, monitors international environmental legislation developments, and oversees compliance with conservation covenants.\n"
